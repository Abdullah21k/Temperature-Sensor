#Arduino Thermistor Project

* The purpose of this project is to read the tempreture using a thermistor on the Arduino and print the result in Celsius.

##Setup
* Connect Thermistor to 100k resistor in a voltage divider way
* plug the A0 pin to the middle node between 100k and Thermistor
* Upload code to Arduino IDE

##Usage 
* Open the Serial Moniter at 9600 baud to see the tempreture readings.

##Example Output
Tempreture: 72.3 F; 22.4 C
